Intel ICC:

preliminary testing using intel compiler 12.0.4

The makefile doesn't compile Jasper "correctly".  Testing 
fails with writing of jpeg2000 encoded files.  The portland
C compiler fails with the exact same symptoms.  May be
a Jasper source code problem rather than a compiler problem.

Compiling by icc was turned off in the makefile
