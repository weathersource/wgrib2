                       Quick Directions for the  Default Configuration
                       "Any color that you like as long as it's black"

Download source code from

       ftp://ftp.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/wd51we/wgrib2/wgrib2.tgz
       http://www.ftp.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/wd51we/wgrib2/wgrib2.tgz

Untar the compressed tarball

       gunzip wgrib2.tgz
       tar -xvf wgrib2.tar
       
       or if you have gnu tar:  tar -xzvf wgrib2.tgz

Go to the main directory (grib2)

       cd grib2

Define the C compiler that you will be using.  Note icc and pgc have been
found to be incompatible with the Jasper library and are not allowed.

       sh/bash:    export CC=gcc
       csh/tcsh:   setenv CC gcc

Compile the wgrib2 using gnu make

       linux:      make
       MacOS:      gmake
       Unix:       ???    ask system administrators

Try executing wgrib2

      wgrib2/wgrib2 -config

Copy wgrib2 to SOMEPLACE

      cygwin/linux/unis: cp wgrib2/wgrib2 SOMEPLACE


                            Not So Quick Directions
                            So you want some options


Edit the file "makefile" and select the desired options:

# netcdf3: write netcdf files with netcdf-3 library
# netcdf4: write netcdf files with netcdf-4 library
#  only one netcdf library can be installed. do not choose netcdf3 and ncdf4
# regex: regular expression package used by (match,not), POSIX-2
# tigge: enable -tigge option for tigge names
# mysql: write to mysql files
# ipolates: fortran interpolation library
# udf: user defined functions
# openmp: use OpemMP to thread the code
# g2clib: install g2clib decoders (allow -g2clib 2)
#
# the flags are stored in wgrib2/config.h
#

Default options

USE_NETCDF3=1
USE_NETCDF4=0
USE_REGEX=1
USE_TIGGE=1
USE_MYSQL=0
USE_IPOLATES=0
USE_UDF=0
USE_OPENMP=0
USE_G2CLIB=0

In the default configuration, all the code is compiled
using the C compiler.  


On some machines, you will have to define the C compiler
and C preprocessor.  On the NCEP's AIX, I have to define
them by

	export CC=/usr/vacpp/bin/xlc_r
	export CPP=/usr/bin/cpp

Then you have to run gnu make.  (gmake on some machines, make on others)

	make		- on linux
	gmake		- on AIX
	


                          Comments on Netcdf

The makefile is set up to use either netcdf v3 or netcdf v4.  Netcdf-4
makes wgrib2 much bigger, so don't install it unless you really have to.
The source code for netcdf-4 (and necessary hdf5) is also very big
and will have to be downloaded separately.

The netcdf-3 library is included with this distribution.  The library is
compiled in enable-C-only mode which is not be that useful for
fortran code.  Don't use try to link other codes to this library.

The netcdf-4 library has to be downloaded with the HDF5 library and
the shell variable FC has to be set to the default fortran compiler.


                  IPOLATES, interpolation library

IPOLATES is the interpolation library used by the -new_grid options.
In order to use this library, you must have a f90/f95/f2003 fortran compiler.
In order to enable the -new_grid options, the makefile has to have USE_IPOLATES 
enabled and the shell variable, FC, must have the name of the fortran compiler. 
You will have to change the source code if you are not using g95, gfortran, 
openf95 or xlf.

                              MYSQL

Install MySQL requires the appropriate headers and libraries to be installed.
The makefile may have to be modified to reflect the locations of the headers
and libraries.



                     INSTALLING on windows XP

The code including the IPOLATES option compiles in the cygwin development 
system.  You'll have to install extra packages such as the C, gfortran 
compilers and various scripting utilities. 

    Before you compile, you set the default compilers.

    export CC=gcc
    export FC=gfortran
    make

                        INSTALLING on FreeBSD

Set appropriate CC and FC environment variables and try make. wgrib2 v1.9.8
was compiled with clang and gfortran.


                        INSTALLING on Apple OS-X

Has been done. No details.


                        INSTALLING on NCEP's AIX

Define default C, C preprocessor and fortran

   export CC=/usr/vacpp/bin/xlc_r
   export CPP=/usr/bin/cpp
   export FC=xlf_r
   gmake


			Static vs Dynamic Libraries

The various libraries can be created in both dynamic and static versions.  
I've tried to make the add-on libraries static.  

                           Testing Package

Have a testing script that tests an known-good version with a test
version. For new machines, I use the gcc compiled version as the 
"known-good" version.  Not ideal.

                             Problems

Some optional packages require changes to makefile
