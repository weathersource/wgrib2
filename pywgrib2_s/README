Pywgrib2_s is a python module to read and write grib2 using the wgrib2 shared 
library.  There will-be/are various python modules based on wgrib2 (pywgrib2_s, 
pywgrib2_lite, and pywgrib2_xr).  

At the time of release of wgrib2 v3.0.0 (9/2020), pywgrib2_s is in alpha-beta 
stage of software development.  Changes to the API could occur but breaking
current python code is unlikely.  The documentation is complete, but needs to 
be polished.  Sample code examples (cookbook) have been tested but documentation 
for the cookbook needs to be done.

At this time (9/2020), pywgrib2_s only works on linux and MacOS using the GNU
compilers.  I (WNE) am using pywgrib2_s for my real work.


TODO: See if Windows support is possible using cygwin.
      As for supporting additional systems, the developers are limited to
       Redhat/Ubuntu/SUSE linux, MacOS and Windows 10.
